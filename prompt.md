Hereâ€™s a detailed and structured **AI prompt** you can give to **another AI assistant** (like an AI coder or builder) to **create the complete project** based on everything we've discussed:

## ðŸ§  AI Prompt to Build the Full Project

> **Prompt:**
>
> Build a full-stack, containerized **real-time stock market dashboard** with the following features and technologies:
>
> ### ðŸ§© **Problem It Solves:**
> - Helps investors (beginners, intermediate, advanced) screen, analyze, and track stocks based on live and fundamental data.
> - Provides categorized views like 52-week highs/lows, top gainers/losers, and undervalued stocks.
> - Sends real-time alerts for market movements or user-defined conditions (e.g., P/E < 10 and ROE > 15).
> - Adapts the user interface based on experience level.
>
> ---
>
> ### ðŸ”§ **Tech Stack Requirements:**
>
> #### âœ… **Frontend:**
> - Built using **React.js** (or Flask-Jinja2 templates if needed)
> - Includes dashboard views, smart filters, stock detail pages, and real-time alerts
> - Use `Chart.js`, `Plotly`, or `D3.js` for charts
> - Supports 3 user modes: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
>
> #### âœ… **Backend:**
> - **Python + Flask**
> - RESTful APIs to serve:
>   - Screener results
>   - Stock metadata (P/E, ROE, etc.)
>   - Alert management
>   - User engagement logs
> - **WebSocket (Flask-SocketIO)** support for real-time updates
>
> #### âœ… **Streaming & Processing:**
> - **Fluvio** for real-time stock data streaming
> - **Stateful DataFlow Pipeline (Python)** for:
>   - Categorizing stocks (e.g., 52W highs/lows, gainers/losers)
>   - Applying filters (P/E, ROE, ROCE, debt/equity, etc.)
>   - Enriching data from RESTful financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Finnhub)
>
> #### âœ… **Data Storage:**
> - **PostgreSQL** for storing user profiles, preferences, filters, alerts, stock snapshots
> - (Optional) **TimescaleDB** for time-series performance
>
> #### âœ… **Notifications:**
> - Integrate with **Twilio** (SMS), **SendGrid** (email), or **Slack API**
> - Alert when a stock hits a condition (e.g., price spike, low P/E)
>
> #### âœ… **Containerization & Deployment:**
> - Dockerize backend, database, Celery worker
> - Use **Docker Compose** for local development
> - Provide deploy-ready config for:
>   - **Render**, **Railway**, or **Fly.io**
>   - Serve frontend (React or Jinja) + Flask backend + PostgreSQL
>
> ---
>
> ### ðŸ§  Additional Requirements:
> - Create a **user engagement tracker**:
>   - Track time spent, filters used, stock clicks
>   - Use it to refine UX per user level
> - Provide default screener templates (Value Picks, Safe Bets, Growth Rockets)
> - Store alerts and recently triggered alert logs
>
> ---
>
> ### ðŸ“¦ Deliverables:
> - Full codebase (frontend + backend)
> - Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
> - `README.md` with setup, deployment, and API docs
> - Optional: Architecture diagram or UI wireframe in `/docs/`
